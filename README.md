PUBLIC API REQUESTS

In this project, I've built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the nation. 

I've created a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I've used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that returned data to build a prototype for my Awesome Startup employee directory.

I've requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address, etc.

I've added a few extra stylings as well:

*a background image to my body
*Text shadows, color, font-famliy and font-size to my H1 Header & my noMatch div as well

Enjoy!
